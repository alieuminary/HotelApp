# Simple Hotel Management Application

# Description

- This is a simple hotel management system application that showcases some of the things I learned teaching myself C#/.NET.

- This project is a web application where a guest may book a room based on the dates and availability of rooms. In addition, it is also a WPF desktop application where an employee would use to check in a guest. Both project types are contained in one solution. 

- Additionally there are database files containing store procedures, tables, and a publish profile that the application will be using in context of.
